implement a bucket sort algorythem

What is bucket sort?
sorting technique that involves dividing elements into various groups, or buckets. 
These buckets are formed by uniformly distributing the elements. Once the elements are 
divided into buckets, they can be sorted using any other sorting algorithm. 
Finally, the sorted elements are gathered together in an ordered fashion.
